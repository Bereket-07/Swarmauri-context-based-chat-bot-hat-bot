3. Frontend Development:
   - Build an interactive user interface using Streamlit to facilitate real-time conversations.
   - Implement design elements to enhance user experience, including custom styling and input handling.

4. Backend Development:
   - Set up a Flask server to manage API endpoints for integration.
   - Create endpoints to handle user queries, model selection, and context management.

5. Dynamic Response Generation:
   - Leverage selected LLM models to generate dynamic responses based on user input and context.
   - Ensure that the system can handle a variety of topics and provide insightful answers.

6. Evaluation and Optimization:
